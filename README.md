Description of the Course
--------------------------------------------------------------  
This course introduces the basics of natural language processing, also known as computational linguistics. The course will focus exclusively on written text, as that is what we, as Data Scientists, are most often confronted with. The course will cover basic text processing techniques including regular expressions, tokenization, and vectorization. It will continue to more advanced techniques such as syntactical parsing, information extraction, and sentiment analysis.

### Prerequisites
A curiosity about how to computationally approach natural language.

### By the end of this course, you will be able to:  
- Use regular expressions
- Build a text classifier
- Programmatically discover and resolve syntactic ambiguity
- Extract entity and relation information from text

## Structure of the Class
This course will employ a ["flipped" classroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) model. What that means is that lectures will take place *outside* of class, via the MOOC course developed by Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning. Classroom time will be devoted to resolving questions that have arisen from the lectures and/or readings and, primarily, for doing project work. A typical class will follow this structure:

1. Lecture Checks for Understanding and Review
2. iRAT (individual readiness assessment test)
3. tRAT (team readiness assessment test)
4. Review RAT
5. Pair Programming
6. Pair Presentations
7. Peer Review

#### RATs
The readiness assessment tests (RATs) are intended to ensure that students comprehended the material consumed between classes. Students unsure of their comprehension should bring questions to be addressed before the individual RAT. After each student has answered all the questions on the RAT individually, the class will split into two teams, who will then review their answers and attempt to reach consensus. Misunderstandings are often better addressed by peers. It is important that all members of each team understand the solution provided by their team. Finally, the answers to the questions will be gone over by the class, hopefully resolving any final misunderstandings before proceeding with the projects.

#### Exercises
The RATs are meant to assess the first three levels of [Bloom's Taxonomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy#Cognitive), namely knowledge, comprehension, and analysis. The exercises are meant to develop the latter three levels: analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Students will separate into pairs. We will employ a pair programming approach here. Classes may involve a variety of small exercises or a single larger project. In the case of several small exercises, each pair will start on a different exercise and move on to the next in series. So, for example, group A will start with exercise 1, group B with exercise 2, and so on. When group A finishes exercise 1, they will move on to exercise 2. Say there are four exercises, when group D finishes exercise 4, they will move onto exercise 1, etc. At the completion of each exercise, the pair will swap roles. That is, the driver will become the navigator, and vice versa. 

#### Pair Programming
[Pair programming](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/pairing.html) is a counter-intuitive way to make programmers more efficient in that, for every terminal, there are two programmers instead of one. One acts as the "driver", the other as the "navigator". Only the driver codes. If the navigator uses her computer at all, it should be only to reference resources. Constant communication is essential. Pairs will change every class.

#### Presentations
At the end of the time period, pairs will stop their work and present their solution(s) to the rest of the class. The purpose of this is two-fold.  
1. All students will learn from all exercises, whether or not they had time to complete them in class.  
2. Students will get to see alternative approaches to the exericeses they did complete.

#### Peer Evaluation
In addition to the iRATs and tRATs, your grade will depend upon peer evaluation. You will evaluate the other member of your pair, that he maintained his or her role (as driver or nagigator) and was helpful. You will also evaluate the other groups on their presentations. Did you understand what they did? Peer evaluations will be rated 0-4 points. For group evaluations, you may give no more than one (1) 4 point score per class. In order to protect anonymity, peer feedback will be returned only every two weeks.

Grading
----------------------
| Portion | Points | Number | Total |Percentage |
|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:-----:|:---------:| 
| iRAT    |      8 |     25 |   200 |       20% |
| tRAT    |      8 |     25 |   200 |       20% |
| Pair Eval  |   8 |     25 |   200 |       20% |
| Group Eval |   8 |     25 |   200 |       20% |
| Final Project |  200 |  1 |   200 |       20% |

The grading system is designed such that if you do the homework and you participate in class, you should be able to earn an A.

Course Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------  
### Attendance
Students are required to attend every class. This is necessary both for your own grade and for your classmates. If you do not attend, then one of your colleagues will not have a pair. It is very important you attend each class. If you cannot, please let us know as early as possible. 

### Lab Exercises  
Participation in and completion of lab exercises is a requirement for this course. Each unit includes exercises to provide practice applying techniques discussed in class and to reveal deficiencies in understanding in preparation for skills tests.  

## Academic Integrity
As per the University's [Academic Integrity Policy and Procedures](http://www.newhaven.edu/334887.pdf):
> The University expects that all students, graduate and undergraduate, will learn in an environment where they work independently in the pursuit of knowledge, conduct themselves in an honest and ethical manner and respect the intellectual work of others. Each member of the University community has a responsibility to be familiar with the definitions contained in, and adhere to, the Academic Integrity Policy. Students are expected to be honest in their academic work. 

Violations of the Academic Integrity Policy include (but are not limited to):

1. **Cheating** -- *i.e.* Don't read off of your neighbors exams
2. **Collusion** -- Group work is encouraged *exept on evaluative exams*. When working together (on exercises, *etc.*) acknowledgement of collaboration is required.
3. **Plagiarism** -- Reusing code presented in labs and lectures is expected, but copying someone else's solution to a problem is a form of plagiarism (even if you change the formatting or variable names).

Students who are dishonest in any class assignment or exam will receive an "F" in this course.
